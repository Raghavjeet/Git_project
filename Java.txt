Preparation Tips:
Practice Coding: Use platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, and CodeSignal to practice coding problems.
Understand Core Concepts: Ensure you have a solid understanding of OOP principles and how they are implemented in Java.
Read Java Documentation: Familiarize yourself with the official Java documentation and Oracle tutorials.
Mock Interviews: Participate in mock interviews to get a feel of real interview scenarios.
Preparing these topics thoroughly will give you a strong foundation for Java interviews and help you tackle both basic and slightly advanced questions with confidence.
