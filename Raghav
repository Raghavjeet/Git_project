"My name is Raghvendra Singh. I completed my 10th grade from Kiddyâ€™s Corner School in Gwalior and have recently taken my final exams for a polytechnic diploma in Computer Science Engineering. I come from a family of four members. In my free time, I enjoy playing cricket and occasionally reading books. One of my strengths is that I learn things very quickly, which allows me to adapt and acquire new skills efficiently. However, I am working on improving my punctuality as it is an area where I can grow."[C
